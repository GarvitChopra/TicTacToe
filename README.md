# TicTacToe
This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using React. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their chosen symbol. The game keeps track of scores for each player (blue and red) and persists the scores even after reloading the page.

## Features
- Play Tic-Tac-Toe against another player.
- Alternate turns between blue and red.
- Display the winner (blue or red) or indicate a draw.
- Track and display scores for each player.
- Scores are retained even after reloading the page.

- Winning: The first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of their symbols wins.
